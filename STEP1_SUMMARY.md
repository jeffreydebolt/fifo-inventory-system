# Step 1: Core Domain Extraction - Complete ✅

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Core Directory Structure
- `/core/` - Contains pure Python domain logic with no external dependencies
- `/tests/unit/` - Unit tests for core components

### 2. Extracted Core Components

#### `core/models.py`
- **PurchaseLot**: Represents inventory lots with FIFO tracking
- **Sale**: Represents sales transactions (including returns)
- **COGSAttribution**: Detailed cost allocation for each sale
- **InventorySnapshot**: Point-in-time inventory state
- **COGSSummary**: Monthly aggregated COGS data
- **ValidationError**: Structured error reporting

#### `core/fifo_engine.py`
- Pure FIFO calculation logic extracted from `fifo_calculator_enhanced.py`
- Handles:
  - FIFO allocation from oldest lots first
  - Return processing (negative quantities)
  - Multi-lot allocations
  - Validation error tracking
  - Summary generation by SKU/month

#### `core/validators.py`
- Data validation logic separated from processing
- Validates:
  - Sales data integrity
  - Purchase lot consistency
  - Date availability (inventory before sales)
  - Sufficient inventory quantities

### 3. Created Comprehensive Unit Tests

#### `test_fifo_engine.py`
- Tests core FIFO logic scenarios:
  - Simple single-lot allocation
  - Multi-lot spanning allocations
  - Return processing
  - Insufficient inventory handling
  - Multiple SKU processing
  - Monthly summary calculations

#### `validate_core_parity.py`
- Manual validation script showing calculations match expected results

#### `test_enhanced_calculator_comparison.py`
- Complex scenario testing including returns and multiple SKUs

## Test Results

All unit tests pass:
```
tests/unit/test_fifo_engine.py - 7 tests PASSED
```

Core calculations verified:
- FIFO allocation: ✅ Correctly takes from oldest lots first
- Multi-lot spanning: ✅ Properly splits across lots
- Returns: ✅ Adds inventory back to oldest lot
- COGS calculation: ✅ Accurate cost * quantity math
- Summary generation: ✅ Correct monthly aggregation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Pure Domain Logic**: Core has zero dependencies on external libraries or databases
2. **Immutable Models**: Used dataclasses for clear, type-safe data structures
3. **Decimal Precision**: All monetary calculations use Decimal for accuracy
4. **Validation Separation**: Validation logic is separate from business logic
5. **Error Collection**: Validation errors are collected, not thrown

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_fifo_engine.py -v

# Run validation script
python3 tests/unit/validate_core_parity.py

# Run comparison test
python3 tests/unit/test_enhanced_calculator_comparison.py
```

## Next Steps

With the core domain successfully extracted and tested, we can proceed to:
- Step 2: Create adapter layer for CSV/Supabase integration
- Step 3: Add multi-tenant support
- Step 4: Implement rollback mechanism
- Step 5: Build REST API
- Step 6: Connect dashboard and add SP-API stub

The core engine is now ready to be wrapped with adapters while maintaining the exact same calculation logic as the legacy system.
