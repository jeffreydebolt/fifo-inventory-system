# Next Steps for Completing Step 5: CI/CD, Monitoring, and Ops Runbook

## Current Status
Step 5 is approximately 85% complete. The following components have been created but need to be organized and committed:

### âœ… Already Created:
1. `.github/workflows/api-ci.yml` - API CI/CD pipeline
2. `.github/workflows/dashboard-ci.yml` - Dashboard CI/CD pipeline  
3. `Dockerfile` - For API containerization
4. `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
5. `api/app.py` - Updated with Sentry and Prometheus monitoring
6. `cogs-dashboard/package.json` - Updated with Sentry dependency
7. `cogs-dashboard/src/index.js` - Updated with Sentry initialization
8. `docs/BACKUP_RECOVERY.md` - Comprehensive backup procedures
9. `docs/SECRETS_ROTATION.md` - Complete secrets management guide
10. `README_OPS.md` - Full operations runbook
11. `scripts/rollback_and_rerun.sh` - Rollback/rerun support macro

## Remaining Micro-Steps

### 1. Create Missing Support Scripts
**Files to create:**
- `scripts/daily_health_check.sh` - Daily system health checks
- `scripts/weekly_metrics.sh` - Weekly metrics collection
- `scripts/emergency_key_rotation.sh` - Emergency key rotation
- `scripts/check_key_expiry.sh` - Key expiration monitoring
- `scripts/backup_health_check.sh` - Backup verification
- `scripts/csv_validation_response.sh` - CSV error helper

### 2. Create Support Macros Documentation
**File to create:**
- `docs/SUPPORT_MACROS.md` - Documentation for all support scripts

### 3. Make Scripts Executable
**Command to run:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### 4. Commit Current WIP
**Commands:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "WIP: Step 5 - CI/CD, monitoring, and ops infrastructure (partial)

- GitHub Actions workflows for API and dashboard
- Sentry integration started
- Backup and secrets documentation
- Operations runbook
- First support macro (rollback_and_rerun.sh)

Work in progress - additional scripts pending"
git push
```

### 5. Complete Remaining Scripts and Final Commit
**After creating remaining scripts, final commit:**
```bash
git add scripts/
git add docs/SUPPORT_MACROS.md
git commit -m "feat: Complete Step 5 - CI/CD, monitoring, and ops infrastructure

- Add remaining support macros for operations
- Daily health check and weekly metrics scripts  
- Emergency key rotation and expiry monitoring
- CSV validation error response helper
- Comprehensive support macros documentation
- Make all scripts executable

Completes Step 5 deliverables:
âœ… GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
âœ… Deploy pipelines with tag/merge triggers
âœ… Sentry monitoring integration
âœ… Prometheus metrics for API
âœ… Backup and recovery procedures
âœ… Secrets rotation guide and scripts
âœ… Operations runbook with troubleshooting
âœ… Support macros for common operations
