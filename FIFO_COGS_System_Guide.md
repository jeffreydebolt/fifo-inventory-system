# FIFO COGS Calculation System - Complete Guide

## üéØ What This System Does

The FIFO (First In, First Out) COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) calculation system is designed to:

1. **Track Inventory by Purchase Lots**: Each purchase lot has a unique ID, SKU, quantity, cost, and arrival date
2. **Calculate COGS Using FIFO Logic**: When sales occur, the system allocates costs from the oldest inventory first
3. **Update Inventory in Real-Time**: Automatically reduces remaining quantities in Supabase as sales are processed
4. **Handle Returns**: Processes negative quantities by adding inventory back to the oldest lots
5. **Validate Data**: Ensures sales can be fulfilled from available inventory before processing
6. **Generate Reports**: Creates detailed COGS attribution and summary reports

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Supabase account and database
- Required Python packages (see installation below)

### Installation
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install pandas supabase python-dotenv openpyxl

# Clone or download the system files
# Ensure you have the main script: fifo_calculator_enhanced.py
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
python fifo_calculator_enhanced.py \
  --sales_file "path/to/sales_data.csv" \
  --output_dir "output_directory" \
  --log_file "processing_log.txt"
```

## üìä Data Format Requirements

### Sales Data Format
Your sales CSV/Excel file must contain these columns:

| Column Name | Description | Format | Example |
|-------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| `SKU` | Product identifier | Text | "ABC123" |
| `Units Moved` | Quantity sold | Number | 50 |
| `Month` | Sales month | Text | "June 2025" |

**Important Notes:**
- Column names are case-sensitive
- The system will try to match variations (e.g., "Units Moved" vs "units moved")
- SKUs are normalized (uppercase, no spaces/special chars) for matching
- Quantities are cleaned (removes $, commas, handles Excel errors)

### Purchase Lots Data (Supabase)
The system expects a `purchase_lots` table with these columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `lot_id` | UUID | Unique lot identifier |
| `po_number` | Text | Purchase order number |
| `sku` | Text | Product SKU |
| `received_date` | Date | When inventory arrived |
| `original_unit_qty` | Integer | Initial quantity |
| `unit_price` | Decimal | Cost per unit |
| `freight_cost_per_unit` | Decimal | Shipping cost per unit |
| `remaining_unit_qty` | Integer | Current available quantity |

## üîß Monthly Update Process

### Step 1: Prepare Sales Data
```bash
# Clean your sales data
# Ensure proper column names and formats
# Save as CSV or Excel file
```

### Step 2: Upload New Purchase Lots
```bash
# Use the lot uploader script
python supabase_lot_uploader.py --file "new_lots.csv"
```

### Step 3: Run COGS Calculation
```bash
python fifo_calculator_enhanced.py \
  --sales_file "sales_june_2025.csv" \
  --output_dir "june_2025_cogs" \
  --log_file "june_processing.log"
```

### Step 4: Review Results
Check the output directory for:
- `cogs_attribution_supabase.csv` - Detailed line-by-line COGS
- `cogs_summary_supabase.csv` - Summary by SKU and month
- `updated_inventory_snapshot_supabase.csv` - Post-processing inventory
- `validation_errors.csv` - Any issues found (if validation failed)

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Validation Mode
Run validation without processing:
```bash
python fifo_calculator_enhanced.py \
  --sales_file "sales_data.csv" \
  --output_dir "validation_output" \
  --log_file "validation.log" \
  --validate_only
```

### Returns Processing
The system automatically handles returns (negative quantities):
- Returns are processed before regular sales
- Inventory is added back to the oldest lots first
- Negative COGS are calculated for reporting

### Date Validation
The system warns about sales that occur before inventory arrival:
- Uses FIFO logic to allocate from available inventory
- Logs warnings for future reference
- Continues processing with available inventory

## üìà Current System Capabilities

### ‚úÖ What Works Well
1. **Robust Data Handling**: Handles various date formats, currency symbols, Excel errors
2. **Flexible Column Matching**: Tries exact, normalized, and partial matches

## üîç Data Formatting Best Practices

### Sales Data Preparation
1. **Column Headers**: Use exact column names or close variations
2. **SKU Formatting**: 
   - Keep SKUs consistent across systems
   - Avoid special characters when possible
   - Use the same SKU format as purchase lots

3. **Date Formatting**:
   - Use "Month Year" format (e.g., "June 2025")
   - Or use standard date formats (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Ensure all dates are in the same timezone

4. **Quantity Formatting**:
   - Remove currency symbols ($, ‚Ç¨, etc.)
   - Remove commas from numbers
   - Use positive numbers for sales, negative for returns

### Purchase Lots Preparation
1. **SKU Consistency**: Match SKU format exactly with sales data
2. **Date Accuracy**: Ensure received dates are correct for FIFO logic
3. **Cost Accuracy**: Include both unit price and freight costs
4. **Quantity Validation**: Ensure remaining quantities are accurate

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "SKU not found in inventory"
- Check SKU spelling and format
- Verify SKU exists in purchase lots
- Use SKU mapping suggestions from validation report

### "Insufficient quantity available"
- Check if inventory was already consumed by previous sales
- Verify remaining quantities in purchase lots
- Consider uploading additional inventory

### "Invalid date format"
- Ensure dates are in supported formats
- Check for hidden characters or formatting issues
- Use consistent date format throughout file

### "Column not found"
- Verify column names match expected format
- Check for extra spaces or special characters
- Use the exact column names shown in requirements

## üìû Support and Maintenance
